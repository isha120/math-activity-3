What is Kepler's third law?

Kepler's Third Law: the squares of the orbital periods of the planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi major axes of their orbits. Kepler's Third Law implies that the period for a planet to orbit the Sun increases rapidly with the radius of its orbit.

Kepler's Third Law?

Equation 13.8 gives us the period of a circular orbit of radius r about Earth: T = 2 π r 3 G M E . T = 2 π r 3 G M E . For an ellipse, recall that the semi-major axis is one-half the sum of the perihelion and the aphelion.

Kepler's Third Law?

The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. ... Kepler's Third Law: Kepler's third law states that the square of the period of the orbit of a planet about the Sun is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.
